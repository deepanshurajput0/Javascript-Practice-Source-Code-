// and or operator 

// let firstName = "Deepanshu";
// let age = 18;

// if(firstName[0]==="D" && age===18){
//     console.log("your name starts with D and your age is 18")
// }else{
//     console.log("your name does not start with D and your age is not 18")
// }

// And operator - It checks both the condition thats why it returns the first condition 

// let firstName = "Deepanshu";
// let age = 18;

// if(firstName[0]==="D" || age===18){
//     console.log("your name starts with D and your age is 18")
// }else{
//     console.log("your name does not start with D and your age is not 18")
// }

// Or operator - It checks only one condition  and if the condition is true then it prints the statement
